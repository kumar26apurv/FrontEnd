        The post-war American comic market saw superheroes falling out of fashion.[21] Goodman's comic 
        book line dropped them for the most part and expanded into a wider variety of genres than even 
        Timely had published, featuring horror, Westerns, humor, talking animal, men's adventure-drama,
         giant monster, crime, and war comics, and later adding jungle books, romance titles, espionage,
          and even medieval adventure, Bible stories and sports.

    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>
        Atlas, rather than innovate, took a proven route of following popular trends in television
        and films—Westerns and war dramas prevailing for a time, drive-in film monsters another 
        time—and even other comic books, particularly the EC horror line.[25] Atlas also 
        published a plethora of children's and teen humor titles

    <h3>Solo series</h3>
    <p>In 1957, Goodman switched distributors to the American News Company—which shortly 
        afterward lost a Justice Department lawsuit and discontinued its business.[27] 
        Atlas was left without distribution and was forced to turn to Independent News,
        the distribution arm of its biggest rival, National (DC) Comics, which imposed
         draconian restrictions on Goodman's company

        As then-Atlas editor Stan Lee recalled in a 1988 interview, "[We had been]
         turning out 40, 50, 60 books a month, maybe more, and ... suddenly we went ... 
         to either eight or 12 books a month, which was all Independent News 
         Distributors would accept from us."
