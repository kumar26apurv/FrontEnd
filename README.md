# FrontEnd Basics 🚀

This repository contains my learning journey through the **basics of Front-End Development** using:

- **HTML** – Structuring web pages  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Adding interactivity

## 📁 Folder Structure

The project is organized into different folders covering core concepts of:

- HTML (forms, tables, semantic tags, etc.)
- CSS (selectors, flexbox, grid, animations)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, events, basics)

Each folder represents practice and mini-projects I built while learning.

## ✅ Purpose

To build a solid foundation in front-end technologies before diving into frameworks like React or Tailwind CSS.

## 📌 Note

This is a beginner-level repo, ideal for revision or for anyone just starting out with front-end development.
